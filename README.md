# Coursera: Computational Neuroscience
Practical exercises of the MOOC [Computational Neuroscience](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computational-neuroscience/) on Coursera by University of Washington.

## Course Schedule

### Week 1: Introduction & Basic Neurobiology
- This module includes an Introduction to Computational Neuroscience, along with a primer on Basic Neurobiology.
- no exercises
### Week 2: Neural Encoding Models
- What do neurons encode?
- This module introduces you to the captivating world of neural information coding. You will learn about the technologies that are used to record brain activity. We will then develop some mathematical formulations that allow us to characterize spikes from neurons as a code, at increasing levels of detail. Finally we investigate variability and noise in the brain, and how our models can accommodate them.
- exercise on Spike Triggered Averages
### Week 3: Neural Decoding
- How to extract information from neurons?
- In this module, we turn the question of neural encoding around and ask: can we estimate what the brain is seeing, intending, or experiencing just from its neural activity? This is the problem of neural decoding and it is playing an increasingly important role in applications such as neuroprosthetics and brain-computer interfaces, where the interface must decode a person's movement intentions from neural activity.
